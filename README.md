# Peg Solitaire

Peg Solitaire is a variation of Solitaire in which the player has to configure their board to where there is only one peg left.

# How The Game Works

* A peg can only move by jumping over another peg into an empty spot in the board
  * This means the jump can only be 2 spaces, over another peg and into the empty spot
* The peg that is jumped over is then removed from the board
* The game ends in two ways
  * There is only one peg left in the board (WIN)
  * There are no more possible moves to be made (LOSE)
